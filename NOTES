  cannot push unless to branches for tasks assigned to you
  no changes to tests directory

On starting a new task:
  Branch is created on the latest master with tests added
  You see instrustions to checkout the branch, try the tests

Test skeleton:
  routes??
  method specific tests?
  views test?? Part of controller side task
  factory girl + sequencing
  make sure to check effects

  https://github.com/scottburton11/Badgeable -- badges only :/

    username == github username, ACTUALLY github login!
    allow only the list of github usernames we have to login
  User Story:
    number, description

    unique name, description, points, minimum global level,
    branch_name_for(user) (computable), points, time limit,
    claimable? (computable), unlocked? (computable), last_claimed (computable),
    started?, category
  Relations:
    User Story contains tasks
    Task has prerequisites

  polling every 5s

Scoreboard:

Competition Rules:
  Each task belongs to a category.
  Each task awards a certain number of points on completion.
  A task is either unclaimed, claimed, or completed.
  A hacker claims an unclaimed task.
  A hacker can only claim a maximum of one task per category.
  A claimed task cannot be claimed by another hacker unless it remains
    incomplete for a certain interval of time (1 hour)
  A task made available for reclaiming does not count towards the maximum tasks
    per category limit for the first hacker, but DOES count for the second
    hacker.
